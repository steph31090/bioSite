                Jesus's career goal is to become a project manager, a role where 
                he can take full responsibility for projects and guide a team 
                from start to finish. This goal reflects his dedication to growth 
                in the construction field and his desire to apply his leadership 
                skills on a larger scale.

                    One of Jesus's most important personal goals is to buy 
                    a home. For him, owning a home represents stability and a lasting 
                    place for his family, making it a milestone that holds both 
                    practical and emotional significance.

                    <figcaption>
                    Jesus is proud of his marriage, which has lasted over 13 years 
                    despite many people doubting it would work because of his young 
                    age. Staying committed and proving those expectations wrong 
                    makes this accomplishment especially meaningful to him.
