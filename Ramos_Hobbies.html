                    Jesus began going to the gym after a back injury, and it has 
                    since become a regular part of his life. Strength training and 
                    fitness are important to him for both health and personal growth.

                    Reading was not always a hobby for Jesus, but he picked it up 
                    to improve his vocabulary and expand his knowledge. It is now 
                    something he enjoys doing in his free time.

                    Building LEGO sets has been a lifelong interest, starting with 
                    birthday gifts from his aunt. Star Wars sets are his favorite 
                    and allow him to be creative while connecting back to childhood.
